# About

### Something about myself? Well I have been doing this and that, and keen always to learn more. I was thinking the other day the issues related on the public ITC projects. They tend to fail and delay every time, budget explodes etc. Seems that Waterfall is a common method on many large scale projects. And it shows, since in some recent examples when the users got their hands on the product; they encounter number of issues. The software has not been properly tested, it seems to be rather designed for other engineers (like old nokia phones) than to the end users. Well that was my rant of the day.

#### Maybe I will have to add a bit more text here, ok. I have learned some java, python, swift, php, c#, etc. Python may be the nicest of them at the moment. Just doing some fun projects. It's way more easier and nicer to work in a small group with dedicated tasks than doing these courses online, but I guess that's 2019 :-) and the trend has just started. "So not", a legendary ski jumper would say, and I leave this here.
