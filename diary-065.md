# this course

### I took this course because i thought it be valuable to get more understanding on devops, and how, why, when to use it. All automation makes total sense as many things I am doing are just way too repetative. I started with the advanced project; configured travis to make push and published it at gh-pages. However the page does not load the content on gh-pages, but if I clone the repo and run it on my localhost it works fine. Sadly, I don't have time now to start digging into it anymore. 

# learned

### I learned to used Hugo and new stuff of Markdown as well. Wondering would I do a simple webpage using Hugo or Django. The latter I know beforehand. Well there are too many things to learn and the best is to keep things as easy as possible. Let's see where some future project will lead to. These have been good fundamental information through this course.
